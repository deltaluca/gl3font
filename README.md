Simple, high quality font rendering for opengl.

Whilst the API in this library is specific to Haxe and the hx-ogl API, the ttfcompile tool would be easily used in any suitable environment where we haxe programmable shaders, so any stage3d (flash), or other opengl/directx environment.

Based upon Valve's siggraph paper: http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf

### ttfcompile:

This small c++ tool takes a font file (compatible with freetype2), eg TrueType .ttf, and produces a texture atlas .png of a given set of characters (By default all ISO-1 Latin characters) as a signed distance field, together with a .dat file describing necessary information to make use of the atlas.

    ./ttfcompile font size gap search-radius output-size [-chars=char-set] [-o=output-name]

* `font` : The font file (eg: /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf)
* `size` : Pixel size for font when rendering an intial atlas of characters. Should aim for some large value like `250` so that we have a sufficiently high quality atlas to compute the distance field from.
* `gap`  : Pixel gap between characters in initial atlas, a value of `3` seems to give a good tradeoff between efficiency in terms of how large the output image must be to get good quality, whilst preventing adjacent characters intefering in the distance field.
* `search-radius` : Pixel radius in the initial high quality atlas for performing brute-force search of nearest boundary, needs to scale with the pixel font size, a value of `60` for a font size of `250` seems to work well.
* `output-size` : Pixel size for the dimensions of the output distance field (Actual output may likely have one dimension shorter, output is not generally an exact square).
* `char-set` : Set of unicode characters to use for the atlast, by default all of the ISO-1 latin code page.
* `output-name` : Name for output files (and location), output files written as output-name.png and output-name.dat. By default the given font file name/location is used for output-name.

A set of fonts are already pregenerated in the free and dejavu subdirectories generated by the commands listed in the ttfcompile/given bash script.

The ttfcompile tool depends on libraries: libpng, png++, icu, freetype2 and requires c++11 compatible compiler.

The output .dat file has the following, simple (binary) format:

```
character-count : uint32  // number of characters in the font atlas
line-height     : float   // height between baselines for font rendering.
line-ascender   : float   // (not-guaranteed) height from the base line to
                             highest point in the font.
line-descender  : float   // (not-guaranteed) height from the base line to
                             lowest point in the font.
{ character-code : uint32   // Unicode code point associated with atlas index.
  horiz-advance  : float    // How much to advance pen-position after
                               rendering this character.
  offset-left    : float    // horizontal offset to pen-position when
                               rendering this character.
  offset-top     : float    // vertical offset to pen-position when
                               rendering this character.
  char-width     : float    // width of character
  char-height    : float    // height of character
  atlas-u        : float    // normalised tex-coordinate in atlas
                               for this character.
  atlas-v        : float    // normalised tex-coordinate in atlas
                               for this character.
  atlas-w        : float    // normalised width in atlas for character.
  atlas-h        : float    // normalised height in atlas for character.
}  <-- repeated character-count times.
{ horiz-kerning  : float    // horizontal offset to be applied before rendering
                               a character based on previously rendered char.
  repeats        : uint32   // number of times this kerning value is repeated in
                               the matrix.
}  <-- repeated as many times as is necessary to enumerate
      character-count * character-count entries.
```
example, the kerning matrix:
```
[[ 0, 0, 0, 1 ]
 [-1, 1, 1, 0 ]
 [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
 [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ]]
```     
would be encoded in the .dat file as
```
0:ft, 3:u32, 1:ft, 1:u32, -1:ft, 1:u32, 1:ft, 2:u32, 0:ft, 5:u32, 1:ft, 4:u32
```

### gl3font/Font.hx:

Simple API for rendering said fonts generated with ttfcompile using hx-ogl.

### samples/:

Basic usage example.

Support for full unicode, with pre-built atlases supporting all ISO-1 latin code page.
